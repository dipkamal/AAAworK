# Evaluating PASA on non-image data

In this section, we demonstrate the application of PASA on non-image data. We evaluate PASA on network intrusion detection model and dataset. You will need to download updated CIC-IDS2017 dataset to run the code in this directory. You can find the dataset [here](https://intrusion-detection.distrinet-research.be/CNS2022/Datasets/). Similar to image data, we learn thresholds for prediction and attribution sensitivity from benign dataset and use it to identify adversarial samples. It is important to note that adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, BIM, CW) on this dataset is performed on feature-space and hence, might produce unrealistic samples, that are not physically realizable.
