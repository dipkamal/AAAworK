# Evaluating PASA on non-image data

In this section, we demonstrate the application of PASA on non-image data. We evaluate PASA on network intrusion detection model and dataset. You will need to download CIC-IDS2017 dataset to run the code in this directory. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html).
