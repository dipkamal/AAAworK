In this section, we demonstrate the application of PASA on non-image data. We evaluate PASA on network intrusion detection model and dataset. You will need to download NSL-KDD dataset to run the code in this directory. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd).
